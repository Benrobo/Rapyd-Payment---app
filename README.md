## Inspiration

Foreign exchange fees on multiple online card payments for each large transaction across borders could be very costly. According to a publication by Nilson Report; credit, debit and prepaid cards generated $9.443 trillion in purchase volume in 2021 up 23.2% from 2020. U.S. merchants who accepted those cards as payment for goods and services paid $137.83 billion in processing fees, an increase of 24.3% from the prior year. https://nilsonreport.com/mention/1586/1link/

## What it does

Raypal is a web application that leverages on `Rapyd Virtual Account API` and `Rapyd Wallet` to provide Virtual International Bank Account Numbers that businesses can use to accept bank transfer payments in various currencies of various regions where customers are located.

Such solution cuts out the foreign exchange charges that come from converting every single international payment into your preferred currency.
Enable businesses to expand quickly into new territories.
